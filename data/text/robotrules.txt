Robot functions very similarly to the base-game, except your jackpot skills are now
randomized and picked from a massive list of 50+ newly made skills at the start of
every turn! If you want to check the full list of possible skills, you can do so
by checking your enemy's loadout, where a button will show up.

Have fun~!
