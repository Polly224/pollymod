Robot functions very similarly to the base-game, except your jackpot skills are now
randomized and picked from a massive list of 50+ newly made skills at the start of
every turn! 

Clicking the "ROLLABLE SKILLS" button next to the run button
will show you ever skill you can possibly roll at any given time. 
This list updates whenever you level up!

Have fun~!
