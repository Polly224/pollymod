Pirate is a character heavily based on the original enemy's two equipment,
with gimmicks revolving around [recycle]re-uses and the newly added [retrigger]re-triggers!
Whenever you see an equipment with the text "[recycle] on n", that means
you can use that equipment a 2nd time if you insert a dice with the value n.
Think of Pirate Hook in the base-game!

[retrigger]Re-triggers function similarly. Instead of letting you put in a 2nd dice,
[retrigger]re-triggers trigger the same equipment again with the same dice inserted!
This also still triggers any "on [recycle][]" effects.

Have fun~!
