look i'm not gonna hit you with a full legal disclaimer bc i honestly don't know how to do those, just. if you use code from this project in your own mods? fine! idm, do whatever you want with my code. if you're taking a whole character or more of my mod and re-using it for yours? give credit at the very least, and please contact me on discord at @pollyamory first. you can use my code for whatever, but if you're using anything aside from the code, ask me first, please. thank you.
