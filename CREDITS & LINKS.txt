Polly
- It's me, Polly! I'm not going to detail what I worked on for the mod, not a fan of showing off or anything. Pollymod wouldn't have made it this far without the many lovely people helping with it. If you're looking for something in the list below that wasn't mentioned, it was probably done by me. If you're interested in more of my works (game dev, writing or otherwise!), my portfolio can be found here:

Jultima
- Jultima (or Jamie Embers) is a phenomenal writer, artist, voice actress and my lovely sister. She helped a lot throughout the modding process with a bunch of playtesting, support, feedback, as well as the concepts for the majority of the enemies! She's a wonderful person. If you'd like to check out any of her other works (which you definitely should!), you can find her here:

nixus777
- nixus777 has been incredibly helpful from behind the scenes throughout the mod's development, ever since Robot first dropped and I started work on Pirate. I am incredibly thankful for his help, and Pirate most likely wouldn't have been possible without nixus helping and keeping everything a secret. You can find more of his projects here:

osacat
- osacat is a very talented artist who drew the enemy sprites for Polly and Jimbo. Their art is amazing, and they deserve more of a following! You can find more of their art, including their commission sheet, here:
